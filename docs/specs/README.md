# Specs Folder

This folder holds implementation/problem specs linked from [Roadmap](../ROADMAP.md).

## Rules

- Every roadmap item should link to one spec file.
- Use `SPEC_TEMPLATE.md` for new specs.
- Keep metadata current (`Status`, `Last Updated`, `Owner`).
- When a spec is completed, update roadmap status and record validation commands/results in the spec.
